# Pheonix Template For Noop Workshop and Cloud

This repository contains the source code developed as part of the [Noop Guide](https://noop.dev/blog/launch-phoenix-app/) for getting a Phoenix app up and running on Noop Workshop and Cloud.

That guide contains complete instructions for assembling and deploying a Phoenix app on Noop. The specific deployment process is based on the [official Phoenix release guide](https://hexdocs.pm/phoenix/releases.html).
